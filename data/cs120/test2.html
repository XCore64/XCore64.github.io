		<p title="skin">It has long been known that there is more than one way to skin a cat, but experts have debated just how many ways there are.  The latest research from the Johns Hopkins School of Forensic Vetrinary Medicine indicates that there are exactly three ways to skin a cat. The first way is A.  The second way is B.  The third way is C.  If you learn all three approaches, you will always be prepared to skin any cat you encounter.</p>
